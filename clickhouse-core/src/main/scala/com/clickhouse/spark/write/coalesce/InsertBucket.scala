/**
 * Per-target buffer of record-batch handles. A flush is triggered by size (bufferedBytes >=
 * targetBytes), seal(), or a linger timer; draining and the sender call always run on `pool`,
 * never on the submitting (task) thread. submit() blocks while bufferedBytes >= maxBufferedBytes
 * (backpressure). `sender` performs the insert and completes each handle's promise.
 *
 * Byte accounting: a batch's bytes count against `bufferedBytes` from the moment it is buffered
 * until its group's send completes (acked or failed). In-flight groups therefore keep occupying
 * the byte budget, so backpressure reflects total outstanding work, not just the unsent buffer.
